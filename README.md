# Interpreters

Each of these folders contains interpreters for increasingly complicated subset languages of OCaml. Each of the folders come with their own spec files that describe exactly what functions were expected to be present, what they are supposed to do, the ADTs for parsing, the semantics for each portion of the language, and type checking/type inferencing rules as well.
